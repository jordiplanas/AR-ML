# AR-ML
Introduction to UX/UI for Augmented Reality and Machine Learning
## Overview
The porpouse of this seminar is to design and develop a web app that involves AR and machine learning to create a digital interactive experience. While developing the app students will go through the main basic concepts of AI and Machine Learning and the web AR implementation.
## Methodology
The main idea of the course flow is to make a collaborative workshop. So it will be combination of theoretical classes, practical exercises and a final project. Since it will be "collaborative", teachers will be part of the team in ideation and development process and suggestions and apportations from students side will be more than welcome. **We will learn it all // all together**.

The goal of the workshop will be to deliver a final web app that will be evaluated for you final master grade using the following criteria:
- Idea (innovative, scalable, originality...) **30%**
- Design (Good implementation of UX/UI for web apps and AR) **30%**
- Tech (functional and structured code and efficient use of the libraries) **40%**

Theoretical classes will be online in school platform and working sessions willbe presential.

## Tools
To keep improving student's javascript programming skills we will be using libraries in js to prototype. Those libraries, Aframe and ml5.js, are simple and intuitives tools for begginers in AR and ML in the browser.
